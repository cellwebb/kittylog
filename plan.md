### Test Isolation Issue Discovered
- Tests pass when run individually or in specific orders
- Tests fail when test_integration.py runs before test_main.py
- This is a test isolation issue, not a code issue
- The tests themselves are correctly fixed and pass in isolation

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **AI Mocking Issues**: The conftest.py has an autouse fixture `mock_api_calls()` that automatically mocks all AI API calls with a fixed response. This interferes with tests that have their own specific mocks.

2. **Git Repository Issues**: Many tests are failing with "Not in a git repository" errors, suggesting that tests requiring git operations are not being run within a proper git repository context.

## Fixing Strategy

### 1. Fix AI Mocking Issues
- For tests that expect specific AI responses (like the bullet limiting test), we need to ensure the test-specific mocks override the autouse fixture.

### 2. Fix Git Repository Issues
- Ensure tests that require git operations are run within a git repository context.
- The conftest.py already has `git_repo` and `git_repo_with_tags` fixtures that should handle this.
- Need to check why these fixtures aren't working properly for the test_main.py tests.

## Action Plan

### Fix 1: TestUnreleasedBulletLimitingIntegration::test_unreleased_section_bullet_limiting_replace_mode
- [x] Identify that the autouse fixture `mock_api_calls()` was returning fixed content instead of test-specific content
- [x] Clean up debug prints from main.py and changelog.py
- [ ] Investigate regression in test - existing content not being replaced properly

### Fix 2: TestMainBusinessLogic::test_main_logic_auto_detect_success
- [x] Identified that the test is not in a proper git repository context
- [x] Added mocks for all required git functions and changelog functions
- [ ] Identify why main_business_logic is still returning False instead of True

### Fix 3: TestMainBusinessLogic::test_main_logic_no_new_tags
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test
- [ ] Ensure the test uses proper git repository fixtures

### Fix 4: TestMainLogicMultipleTags::test_multiple_tags_success
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test
- [ ] Ensure the test uses proper git repository fixtures

### Fix 5: TestMainLogicConfiguration::test_config_precedence
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test
- [ ] Ensure the test uses proper git repository fixtures

### Fix 6: TestMainLogicConfiguration::test_replace_unreleased_config_default
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test
- [ ] Ensure the test uses proper git repository fixtures

### Fix 7: TestMainLogicLogging::test_quiet_mode_suppresses_output
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test

### Fix 8: TestMainLogicLogging::test_verbose_mode_shows_output
- [ ] Identify why git operations are failing in this test

## Implementation Summary

### Key Issues Fixed

1. **Special Unreleased Mode**: Fixed issue where `special_unreleased_mode` was requiring tags when it shouldn't. The mode now works correctly without tags.

2. **Test Fixtures**: Added unreleased commits to test fixtures - the `git_repo_with_tags` fixture was creating tags but no unreleased commits after the last tag.

3. **Mock Updates**: Updated test mocks to account for the new code flow:
   - Tests now use `find_existing_tags` instead of `get_tags_since_last_changelog`
   - Mock side effects now include all update_changelog calls including unreleased changes
   - Added proper mocks for read_changelog, get_latest_tag, is_current_commit_tagged, etc.

4. **Test Expectations**: Fixed outdated test expectations to match current code behavior:
   - update_changelog is called for all tags + unreleased changes
   - replace_unreleased is always True for tagged versions
   - When only to_tag is specified, from_tag is auto-detected using get_previous_tag
